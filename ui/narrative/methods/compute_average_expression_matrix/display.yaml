description : |
    <p>This App takes as input an ExpressionMatrix object and creates an output ExpressionMatrix object consisting of one column per condition averaged over all the replicates for the given condition. The output matrix, therefore, has the same number of columns as there are conditions.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The average value for a given feature row and a condition column is computed by taking the arithmetic average of the replicate columns associated with the condition and the feature.</p>
