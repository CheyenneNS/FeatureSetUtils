    <p>This app creates an average ExpressionMatrix from input ExpressionMatrix</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The average value is computed by averaging values for each condition from ExpressoinMatrix</p>

    <p>This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone.</p>
