    <p>This App filters feature ids from DifferentialExpressoinMatrix with input Alpha Cutoff and Fold Change Cutoff. And then produce a subset of ExpressionMatrix only containing those feature ids.</p>
    <p>It also creates FeatureSet containing filtered feature ids</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Fold change value to be compared with is calculated based on Fold Change Cutoff Type and Fold Change Cutoff</p>
    <p>For instance: If input 'Fold Change Cutoff Type' is [log2+1] and [1] is given as Fold Change Cutoff. The comparing fold change value is log2 (1+1) = 1</p>


    <p>This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone.</p>
