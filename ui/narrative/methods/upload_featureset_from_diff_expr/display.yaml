          Pairwise Condition
        short-hint : |
          The list of paired conditions (separated by commas).

parameter-groups :
    condition_pairs :
        ui-name : Specific Pairwise Conditions

description : |
    <p>This App selects feature IDs from the input DifferentialExpressionMatrixSet object for features that exhibit an absolute log2 fold change higher than the input cutoff and corrected p-value lower than the input alpha cutoff. It then generates a set of features along with feature type, alias, and associated functional information. </p>

    <p>The App also generates a subset ExpressionMatrix by projecting the output features on the input ExpressionMatrix.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>The upregulated and downregulated feature sets exhibit positive and negative log fold change, respectively.</p>
