    <p>This App filters feature ids from DifferentialExpressoinMatrixSet with input Alpha Cutoff and Fold Change Cutoff. And then produce a subset of ExpressionMatrix only containing those feature ids.</p>
    <p>It also creates FeatureSet containing filtered feature ids</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Filtered feature ids from each DifferentialExpressoinMatrix are merged. But only unique ids are returned.</p>

    <p>Up and Down features are determined by comparing original fold change values with positive and negative Fold Change Cutoff</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If 'Fold Change Cutoff Type' is linear, app is calulating the base 2 logarithm of the original fold change value. Then app uses this computed value to compare with positive and negative Fold Change Cutoff</p>

    <p>This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone.</p>
