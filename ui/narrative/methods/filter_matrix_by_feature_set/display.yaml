            Feature Set
        short-hint : |
            The list of genes which will be used to select a subset of gene expression values.

    filtered_expression_matrix_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            Filtered ExpressionMatrix Suffix
        short-hint : |
            A suffix to be appended to the input matrix to form the name of the output subset of gene expression values.

    <p>This App lets users select a subset of expression values from an ExpressionMatrix which corresponds to a set of genes of interest.</p>

    <p>It takes two inputs: (i) an ExpressionMatrix object (a table of transcript expression values, where rows correspond to genes and columns correspond to experiment conditions, such as that produced from the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_stringtie/run_stringtie/release”>StringTie</a> or <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_cufflinks/assemble_transcripts_using_cufflinks/release”>Cufflinks</a> Apps; and (ii) a genome FeatureSet, such as that produced by <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/FeatureSetUtils/build_feature_set/release”>Build FeatureSet from Genome</a> or one of the BLAST or HMMER search Apps.</p>

    <p>This App produces a new, smaller ExpressionMatrix object (its name formed from the input matrix and the input suffix), which has only those rows corresponding to the genes in the input feature set.</p>
